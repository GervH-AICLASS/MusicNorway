            <h2>What is Ásatrú?</h2>
            <p>Ásatrú is a modern religion that revives, reconstructs, and reimagines the ancient polytheism of Northern Europe. It began in 1972 when Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson and eleven other Icelanders decided to bring back public worship of the Norse gods, goddesses, and land spirits.</p>
            <p class="highlight">The word Ásatrú is modern Icelandic for "Æsir Faith" and refers to belief in the major tribe of Norse deities. Practitioners often self-identify as Heathens.</p>
