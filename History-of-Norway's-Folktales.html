        <h1>Norway's History and the Significance of Folktales</h1>

        <h2>Brief History of Norway</h2>

        <p>Norway's history is a tapestry of fascinating events and cultural developments, spanning over a millennium:</p>

        <div class="history-item">
            <h3>1. Viking Age (793-1066 CE)</h3>
            <p>Norway's seafaring Vikings explored, traded, and raided across Europe and beyond. This era saw the development of advanced shipbuilding techniques and the establishment of Norse settlements in places like Iceland, Greenland, and even North America. The Vikings' influence extended from the British Isles to the Mediterranean, leaving a lasting impact on European history.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-item">
            <h3>2. Middle Ages (1066-1380)</h3>
            <p>Christianity was introduced and gradually replaced Norse paganism. Norway became a unified kingdom under rulers like Olaf II (later Saint Olaf) and HÃ¥kon IV. This period saw the construction of impressive stave churches and the development of a distinct Norwegian literary tradition, including the recording of sagas and the composition of skaldic poetry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-item">
            <h3>3. Union Period (1380-1814)</h3>
            <p>Norway entered into unions with Denmark and later Sweden. The Kalmar Union of 1397 united Norway, Denmark, and Sweden under a single monarch. After its dissolution, Norway remained in union with Denmark until 1814. This period saw significant cultural influences from Denmark, including the adoption of the Danish written language among the Norwegian elite.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-item">
            <h3>4. Path to Independence (1814-1905)</h3>
            <p>Norway gained its constitution in 1814, establishing a parliamentary monarchy. However, it entered into a personal union with Sweden that lasted until 1905. This period saw the rise of Norwegian romantic nationalism, with renewed interest in traditional Norwegian culture, language, and folklore. Key figures like Henrik Ibsen and Edvard Grieg gained international recognition for their contributions to literature and music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-item">
            <h3>5. Modern Era (1905-present)</h3>
            <p>Norway became fully independent in 1905 and has since developed into one of the world's most prosperous nations. The discovery of oil in the North Sea in the late 1960s transformed the country's economy. Today, Norway is known for its high standard of living, robust social welfare system, and commitment to environmental sustainability. It plays an active role in international peacekeeping and diplomatic efforts.</p>
