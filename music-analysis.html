                <pre>
The Whispering Pines Festival

Verse 1:
In the heart of the forest, where shadows grow long
The pines start to whisper, an ancient old song
Lanterns are glowing, in twilight's embrace
As music starts flowing, in this magical place

Chorus:
The Whispering Pines Festival, a night like no other
Where melodies blend with the songs of nature
Under starlit skies, we gather as one
To dance and to dream until the new day has come

Verse 2:
Guitars start to strum, and voices rise high
The drums keep the rhythm as time passes by
Stories are shared 'round the flickering fire
Of legends and lore that never will tire

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
From dusk until dawn, the music plays on
A tapestry of sound, where all belong
In this enchanted grove, where pine needles fall
The spirit of music unites us all

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
As morning light breaks, and the last notes fade away
We carry the magic of this special day
The Whispering Pines Festival, a memory to treasure
A harmony of souls that will echo forever
                </pre>
