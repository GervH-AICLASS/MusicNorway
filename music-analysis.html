                <h2>Lyrics</h2>
                <p>
                    [Verse 1]<br>
                    Whispers in the pines, a gentle breeze<br>
                    Melodies floating through the trees<br>
                    Starlight twinkles, lanterns glow<br>
                    In this clearing, music flows
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Chorus]<br>
                    Whispering Pines Festival, a magical night<br>
                    Where nature and music take flight<br>
                    Voices rise, instruments play<br>
                    In harmony, we'll sway and sway
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 2]<br>
                    Campfires flicker, stories unfold<br>
                    Memories made, both new and old<br>
                    Guitars strum, drums keep the beat<br>
                    In this forest, our souls meet
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Bridge]<br>
                    Under the canopy of stars so bright<br>
                    We dance and sing through the night<br>
                    This moment forever in our hearts will stay<br>
                    At the Whispering Pines, where dreams hold sway
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Chorus]<br>
                    Whispering Pines Festival, a magical night<br>
                    Where nature and music take flight<br>
                    Voices rise, instruments play<br>
                    In harmony, we'll sway and sway
