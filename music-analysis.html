                <h2>Lyrics</h2>
                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <p>
                In the shadow of the fjords<br>
                Moonlight whispers tales<br>
                Old men with their pipes<br>
                The wind across their sails<br>
                Gather 'round the bonfire<br>
                Where echoes softly wail<br>
                The Whispering Pines Festival<br>
                Where dreams never fail
                </p>
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <p>
                Elves in the forest glen<br>
                Shadows weave and twist<br>
                Snow crunches underfoot<br>
                Leave a silver mist<br>
                Folks in knitted sweaters<br>
                Hands in a gentle tryst<br>
                While the wolves' call in the distance<br>
                They shall not resist
                </p>
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>
                Oh the songs of the north<br>
                Where the voices call<br>
                Ancient tunes from the heart<br>
                They bind us all<br>
                A harp and a fiddle under stars so tall<br>
                At the Whispering Pines Festival<br>
                Feel the spirits' thrall
                </p>
            </div>
